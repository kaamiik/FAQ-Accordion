### What I learned

I worked with media query for using this page on Desktop and Mobile screen sizes. i've add an anchor tag to my label and the href with the id of content so you can work with keybord to navigate. finally i learned how to use accordion with HTML, CSS and JS and how to change image icon plus and minus using ::before pseudo class.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
